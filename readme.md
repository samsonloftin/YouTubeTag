It's kinda a slog to create metadata for my anime YouTube videos, so I've built this simple Javascript form to take all the needed information to create my video description and youtube tags. Unfortunately, this is just for private use so I have hardcoded my social media & tags for my own YouTube. I may look into releasing this publicly at some point with an actually designed website.
